#   Path to the serial port for the beacon device. Typically has the form
#   /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Beacon_Beacon_
speed: 50.
#   Z probing dive speed.
lift_speed: 50.
#   Z probing lift speed.
#backlash_comp: 0.5
#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
x_offset: 21.5
#   X offset of beacon from the nozzle.
#y_offset: 0.
#   Y offset of beacon from the nozzle.
#trigger_distance: 2.
#   Beacon trigger distance for homing.
trigger_dive_threshold: 1.
#   Threshold for range vs dive mode probing. Beyond `trigger_distance +
#   trigger_dive_threshold` a dive will be used.
#trigger_hysteresis: 0.006
#   Hysteresis on trigger threshold for untriggering, as a percentage of the
#   trigger threshold.
#cal_nozzle_z: 0.1
#   Expected nozzle offset after completing manual Z offset calibration.
#cal_floor: 0.2
#   Minimum z bound on sensor response measurement.
#cal_ceil: 5.
#   Maximum z bound on sensor response measurement.
#cal_speed: 1.
#   Speed while measuring response curve.
#cal_move_speed: 10.
#   Speed while moving to position for response curve measurement.
#default_model_name: default
#   Name of default beacon model to load.
mesh_main_direction: x
#   Primary travel direction during mesh measurement.
#mesh_overscan: -1
#   Distance to use for direction changes at mesh line ends. Omit this setting
#   and a default will be calculated from line spacing and available travel.
#mesh_cluster_size: 1
#   Radius of mesh grid point clusters.
mesh_runs: 2
#   Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
